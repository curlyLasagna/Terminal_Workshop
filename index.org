#+title: Terminal: Friendlier than it seems

* It's 2023. Why do terminals still exist?
Terminals are awkward, scary and old. Are you trying to be a try hard?

Learning how to use the command line opens up a new avenue to using computers.
** Automation
You can easily automate manual tasks with text compared to clicking buttons around

The power to chain commands together is so powerful, people get paid to do it 😎
** No GUI? No problem
If you want to use a remote server that a cloud platform provides, interacting with the command line is optimal because sending graphics over the internet can be pretty slow.
** Fun!
You don't want to miss out on some cool open source projects

Many of those applications do not come with a GUI
** Blazingly fast 🚀

* She sells sea =shells=  by the sea shore
A shell is the program that interprets the commands that you input.
By default,
| OS      | Default shell           |
|---------+-------------------------|
| MacOS   | zsh                     |
| Windows | powershell              |
| Linux   | bash (varies by distro) |
** Frameworks everywhere
Popular shells, such as zsh have frameworks that can add some pizazz to your shell.
#+begin_notes
There are other frameworks for each type of shell out there.

with [[https://ohmyz.sh/][oh-my-zsh]]
** Alternative shells
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Don't get too hung up on which shell you should use because reddit said so. Explore!
If you find one that works for you, stick with it.
#+END_NOTES
The following are alternative shells:
- [[https://fishshell.com][fish]]
  + Batteries-included
  + What I currently use
- [[https://www.nushell.sh][nushell]]
  + Inspired by PowerShell
- [[https://elv.sh][elvish]]
  + Cool name
- [[https://xon.sh/contents.html][xonsh]]
  + If you like Python
* Basic navigation
+ =ls=
  - Used for listing files in a directory to see what's there
  - Without an argument: Prints out the files within the current directory
  - With an argument: Prints out the files within the argument *directory*
+ =cd=
  - Stands for "change directory"
  - Move around directories
* Working with files
+ =mv=
  - Move or rename a file
+ =cat=
  - Output the contents of a file
+ =touch=
  - Create a file
+ =rm=
  - Delete a file
* What are flags?
Flags modify how a program behaves.
*** ls
When you pass a =-a= flag to =ls=, it will also include hidden files, A.K.A dotfiles since they start with dots

[[./img/lsa.png]]
*** rm
- If you want to delete a directory, you'll have to pass the ~-r~ keyword
- If you certainly want to delete a directory, pass the ~-rf~ keyword.
*** But reading through the manual is exhausting 😫

_But_
#+reveal: split
Before you copy paste and run the command, be sure it's not a troll and you have some basic understanding of the flags provided.

For some commands, such as ~git~, there is an option called ~dry-run~ that tells you what would happen but not actually do it.

Kind of like a sandbox

src_bash[:exports code]{$ bash -n <script>}

* Perfect combo!
The ~|~ (pipe) operator allows you to perform some interesting combos with commands.

Another operator, ~>~ (redirect) allows you to redirect the output of the command somewhere else.

** Making (crappy) code aesthetic
src_bash[:exports code]{$ cat exercise_4.py | lolcat -a -s 60}
[[./img/cat.gif]]
** A more practical example...
Your significant other gets mad at you if you don't send them a "Good morning" text every morning, precisely at 7:00 AM. with a compliment.

With the power of automation, you can easily do so!
*** The script
#+begin_src applescript
-- Taken from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11812184/how-to-send-an-imessage-text-with-applescript-only-in-provided-service
on run {targetBuddyPhone, targetMessage}
    tell application "Messages"
        set targetService to 1st service whose service type = SMS
        set targetBuddy to buddy targetBuddyPhone of targetService
        send targetMessage to targetBuddy
    end tell
end run
#+end_src

Just text yourself and explain cron.

** What's a package manager
A package manager downloads, installs, uninstalls and automagically configures your system to be able to run the command that you want to install.

*** Examples of languages that use package managers
| Language   | Package manager |
|------------+-----------------|
| Python     | pip             |
| JavaScript | yarn or npm     |
| Rust       | cargo           |
| Go         | go modules      |

** Windows
*Disclaimer: I don't main Windows*

#+reveal: split
- [[https://scoop.sh/][Scoop]]
  + Installs packages within the current user's directory so it doesn't pollute the system path
  + My preferred package manager for windows
  + You don't have to be an elevated user
- [[https://chocolatey.org/][Chocolatey]]
  + Has more packages than Scoop
  + Elevated user required
- [[https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli][Winget]]
  + Official Windows package manager
** MacOS
- [[https://brew.sh][Brew]]
  + The de facto package manager for MacOS
  + Many popular packages may be found here
- [[https://www.macports.org][MacPorts]]
- [[https://nixos.org/download.html#nix-install-macos][Nix]]
  + For advanced users
** Linux
- Depends on the distribution, but here's a few examples
| Distro       | Package manager |
|--------------+-----------------|
| Arch based   | pacman          |
| Debian based | apt             |
| Fedora       | yum             |

* How to make the terminal more /aesthetic/ and /awesome/
CLI applications are highly configurable to suit your needs.
#+reveal: split
*Warning: The rabbit hole of customization is a deep one*

** Alternatives to common commands
#+begin_notes
Before I turn this club into the Rust fan club, there has been a trend of rustifying existing commands.
The following commands are all written in Rust.
#+end_notes
- [[https://github.com/sharkdp/fd][fd]]
  + An alternative to the find command.
  + Easier syntax compared to ~find~
- [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][rg]]
  + Stands for rip grep, which looks for patterns within files, similar to grep, but better
  + Can respect =.gitignore= rules
- [[https://github.com/curlyLasagna/Terminal_Workshop][exa]]
  + A modern ~ls~
  + Colors files and directories by default
** ~cd~ at the speed of your thoughts
Using ~cd~ to go to places takes too long 😫
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
I introduce...

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
[[https://github.com/agkozak/zsh-z][z]]
#+begin_notes
Go to your terminal and run z to show the potential of z
#+end_notes
** ~cd~ in style
[[https://github.com/ranger/ranger][ranger]] is a great TUI file manager with vi keybinds and file previews
#+REVEAL_HTML: <img src="./img/ranger.png" class="r-stretch">

** Custom Prompts
- [[https://starship.rs][Starship]]
  + Provides convenient information depending on the context of your current directory
[[./img/starship.png]]
When it sees a .java file, it prints 💩
  #+begin_notes
  I uninroncally enjoy using Java for assignments. It's not really poop but I like to meme
  #+end_notes
** An alternative terminal emulator
Default terminal emulators can get the job done but there are free alternatives that can enhance the terminal experience.

Some terminal emulators are cross-platform, which is nice if you want to keep the same configuration across different systems.
*** Windows
If you haven't upgraded to Windows 11, then the [[https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701][Windows Terminal]] is amazing.
- Tab and window splitting out of the box for multi tasking
- GPU accelerated
- Easily switch between WSL2 and PowerShell
- Intuitive configuration
*** MacOS
#+begin_notes
Open tabs and split panes
Also change the layout of splits
#+end_notes
My daily driver at the moment is [[https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/][kitty]]. I love it for the following reasons:
- GPU accelerated
- Built-in tabs and splits. No need for [[https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki][tmux]], but it's a terminal multiplexer that I highly recommend.
- Ligature and emoji support
[[https://iterm2.com][iTerm2]] and [[https://www.warp.dev][warp]] are also great alternatives
*** Linux
Notable ones that I've used in the past
- [[https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty][Alacritty]]
- [[https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/#:~:text=WezTerm%20is%20a%20powerful%20cross,Download][WezTerm]]
** Text editors
- [[https://neovim.io][neovim]]
- [[https://helix-editor.com][helix]]
- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]]
- [[https://github.com/zee-editor/zee][zee]]
- [[https://amp.rs][amp]]
- [[https://github.com/zyedidia/micro][micro]]
  + Easiest to learn!
#+begin_notes
Open each text editor to some code
Graphical Emacs is a much better experience, but I just wanted to give it a shout out since it's my favorite IDE.

** Have my money Mr. Tim Cook
You just bought a brand new 14" Macbook Pro with an M2 Pro, 32GB Unified Memory, and 1TB SSD Storage 😍

What shell does it ship with?
a. bash
b. Powershell
c. fish
d. zsh
e. Just run src_bash[:exports code]{echo $SHELL} 🤷

** Where did I save it?
After toiling away for days, you finish your data structures assignment 1 hour before it's due. You close the hundred of tabs that you used to research for the solution. You admire your elegant recursive solution. You save all your files and you close your editor. You happily go to blackboard to upload the files but it's not at the usual spot.

*** What do you do?
a. Manually look through your files one by one with ~cat~.
b. Use either ~fd~ or ~find~ command.
c.  Ask ChatGPT to redo the assignment for you.
d. Call it a day because GPA doesn't matter.
** Just copy paste?
You want to save the error output of your program to a file but it's \(\left({{\sum\limits_{k=0}^\infty {\left({2 \over {3}}\right)^{k}}} - (\cos^2x + \sin^2x)}\right) \times {{-4e^{\pi i}}} + {\sum\limits_{k=0}^\infty {\left({1 \over {2}}\right)^{k}}}\) lines long.

What do you do?
a. Type each character one by one.
b. Scroll through your text editor's terminal and copy it.
c. src_bash[:exports code]{./program > error.log}
d. src_bash[:exports code]{./program | error.log}
** Getting ready for class
On the first day of your programming class, your professor asks you to install Java but they make you remotely log in to a Debian Linux server on campus and it doesn't have a GUI. What command do you enter?
a. src_bash[:exports code]{scoop install java}
b. src_bash[:exports code]{apt install java}
c. src_bash[:exports code]{brew install java}
d. src_bash[:exports code]{pacman -Syu java}
