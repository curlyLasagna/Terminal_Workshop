<p>
My name&rsquo;s Luis Gascon. I want to share my workflow and the tools that I love in the command line to break the myth that you have to be an advanced computer user to use it.
</p>

<p>
I recently switched over to a Macbook because the M1 is too good to pass. I&rsquo;m still uncomfortable with MacOS and it&rsquo;s weird quirks but thanks to its UNIX shell, I felt right at home and was able to get things done.

<h2 id="org176705e">It&rsquo;s 2023. Why do terminals still exist?</h2>
<p>
The command line doesn&rsquo;t look modern. Are you trying to be a try hard?
No. It does come with many benefits
Learning how to use the command line opens up a new avenue to using computers.

<p>
You can easily automate manual tasks with text compared to clicking buttons around
The power to chain commands together is so powerful, people get paid to do it ðŸ˜Ž

<h3 id="org9a7e3e0">It&rsquo;s the only way to use certain software</h3>
<p>
Many open source applications are only built to be interacted with the terminal. Some have GUIs made for it, but it takes considerable effort to do so and if you&rsquo;ve played around with some, it&rsquo;s janky and slow.

I&rsquo;m no Windows expert, but from experience, cmd.exe is trash, don&rsquo;t use it.

<h2 id="orgd9afc39">She sells sea <code>shell</code> s by the sea shore</h2>
<p>
A shell is the program that interprets the commands that you input.
By default,
MacOS ships with zsh,
most Linux distributions come with bash,
Windows with powershell
</p>

<p>
The beauty of it is that you can always change it
You can think of a shell like the Python interpreter

<ul>
<li><code>ls</code>

<li><code>ranger</code>

<li>Isn&rsquo;t shipped by default but it makes terminal navigation much more intuitive and visual</li>

<h2 id="org73834be">What are flags?</h2>
<p>
Flags modify how a program behaves.
For example, when you pass a <code>-a</code> flag to <code>ls</code>, it will also include hidden files, A.K.A dotfiles since they start with dots

<h2 id="org2176361">Package managers</h2>
<p>
Imagine clicking buttons to install a program when you could look like this:
&lt;Insert chad using a terminal&gt;
</p>

<p>
A package manager downloads, installs, uninstalls and automagically configures your system to be able to run the command that you want to install.

<h3 id="org6c0c340">Alternatives to common commands</h3>
<p>
Open source is beautiful in that you can try out alternatives to the commands that we just learned about
Some add more functionality, and some are more performant.
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/fd">fd</a>
<ul>
<li>An alternative to the find command. Very handy when you can&rsquo;t find a certain file</li>

</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">rg</a>
<ul>
<li>Stands for rip grep, which looks for patterns within files so if you can&rsquo;t remember which file has the keyword &ldquo;hello world&rdquo;, it&rsquo;ll tell you where it&rsquo;s located and which line in the file it&rsquo;s located.</li>

If you want to stay in the terminal, there are multiple text editors that can be as powerful as GUI-based text editors such as VSCode, and definitely more than Dr. Java ðŸ¤®
